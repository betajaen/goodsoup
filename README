General Notes:

	As of 24-July-2022

	The game is capable of loading the boot script. It then displays the difficulty selection
	dialogue. The game is hardcoded to select the easy option on a mouse click, for which it
	then plays the Monkey Screaming CMI screen. It then plays the opening SAN video, which
	can be skipped by the Escape key. It will then show the chapter one title card, and then
	fade into the scene where Guybrush and Wally are in the Canon room. Wally, Guybrush, the
	canon and some objects are not shown on the screen, but Wally is appearing to be talking
	as the scripts are running in this room.
