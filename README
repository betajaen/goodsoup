General Notes:

	As of 04-August-2022

	The game is capable of loading the boot script. It then displays the difficulty selection
	dialogue. The game is hardcoded to select the easy option on a mouse click, for which it
	then plays the Monkey Screaming CMI screen. It then plays the opening SAN video, which
	shows Monkey Island, then Guybrush in a dodgem car floating in the water writing his log, 
	it then shows the Curse of Monkey Island logo, and then a canon battle between LeChuck and 
	Elaine, with Guybrush who has drifted into the middle stuck in the middle. This can be skipped 
	via the ESCAPE key.

	It will then show the chapter one title card, and then fade into the scene where Guybrush and 
	Wally are in the Canon room. Wally, Guybrush, the canon and some objects are not shown on the
	screen, but Wally is appearing to be talking as the scripts are running in this room.
